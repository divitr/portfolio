            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a freshman at UC Berkeley, where I am pursuing a degree in physics and mathematics. I am still in the early stages of my academic journey, but I am excited to delve into the fascinating realm of physics and mathematics!
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                Since I was young, I have been captivated by physics, mathematics, and computer science. The intricate laws that govern the physical world, the beauty of mathematical equations, and the endless possibilities offered by computer science have all played a significant role in shaping my academic and personal interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within physics, I am particularly drawn to High-Energy Physics, investigating the fundamental particles that make up our universe. I am fascinated by the way elementary particles interact in different ways to form the intricate fabric of our reality. From particle accelerators to advanced computational simulations, the field of High-Energy Physics offers exciting opportunities to explore the frontiers of knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for mathematics stems from its intrinsic elegance and its remarkable ability to unlock the secrets of the universe. The abstract nature of mathematical concepts and their practical applications in various scientific disciplines never cease to amaze me. I am fascinated by the deep connections between mathematics and the fundamental laws that govern the physical universe. I am also very interested in the field of number theory and cryptography, studying the properties and relationships of integers and their applications in developing secure systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my passion for physics and mathematics, I am captivated by the vast realm of computer science. The dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the field captivates me, as it continually pushes the boundaries of innovation and problem-solving. I am particularly intrigued by artificial intelligence and machine learning and their applications in physics.
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                When I am not working, I often spend time practicing classical guitar or reading. Some of my favorite books are <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> by J.D. Salinger, <em>Jazz</em> by Toni Morrison, and <em>The Fall</em> by Albert Camus.
